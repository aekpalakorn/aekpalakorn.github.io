However, the perceptions and needs of such systems remain elusive, hindering efforts in promoting AI adoption in healthcare. Objective: This study aims to provide an overview of the perceptions and needs in AI to increase its adoption in healthcare. Methods: A systematic scoping review was conducted according to Arksey and O'Malley’s five-stage framework. Articles that described the perceptions and needs of AI in healthcare were searched across nine databases – ACM Library, CINAHL, Cochrane–Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science for studies that were published from inception till 21 June 2021. Articles that were not specific to AI, not research studies and not written in English were omitted. Results: A total of 3,666 articles were retrieved of which 26 articles were eligible and included in this review. Mean age ranged from 30-72.6 years old, proportion of males ranged from 0 to 73.4% and the sample sizes for studies with human subject responses ranged from 11 to 2,780. The perceptions and needs of various populations in the use of AI were identified for different healthcare use cases including general, primary and community healthcare, chronic diseases self-management, self-diagnosis, mental health and diagnostics. The use of AI was perceived to be positive due to its (1) availability and ease of use and the (2) potential for improving efficiency and reducing the cost of healthcare service delivery. However, concerns were raised regarding the (1) lack of trust in data privacy, patient safety and technological maturity and the (2) possibility of full automation. Suggestions for improving adoption of AI in healthcare were highlighted – (1) enhance personalization and customizability, (2) enhance empathy and personification of AI-enabled chatbots and avatars, (3) enhance user experience, design, and interconnectedness with other devices and (4) educate the public on AI capabilities. Several corresponding mitigation strategies were also identified in this study. Conclusions: The perceptions and needs of AI in its use in healthcare are crucial in improving its adoption by various stakeholders. Future studies and implementations should consider the points highlighted in this study to enhance the acceptability and adoption of AI in healthcare. This would facilitate the increase in effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare service delivery to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction.

The goal is to learn an embedding of images and recipes in a common feature space, such that the corresponding image-recipe embeddings lie close to one another. Two major challenges in addressing this problem are: 1) large intra-variance and small inter-variance across cross-modal food data; and 2) difficulties in obtaining discriminative recipe representations. To address these two problems, we propose Semantic-Consistent and Attention-based Networks (SCAN), which regularize the embeddings of the two modalities through aligning output semantic probabilities. In addition, we exploit a self-attention mechanism to improve the embedding of recipes. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on the large-scale Recipe1M dataset, and show that we can outperform several state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval strategies for food images and cooking recipes by a significant margin.","tags":[],"title":"Cross-Modal Food Retrieval: Learning a Joint Embedding of Food Images and Recipes with Semantic Consistency and Attention Mechanism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["V N S Rama Krishna Pinnimty","Matt Zhao","Palakorn Achananuparp","Ee-Peng Lim"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1604970035,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604970035,"objectID":"c1881185f7f5fe8edd710ee0f7f63b28","permalink":"https://aekpalakorn.github.io/publication/pinnimty-2020/","publishdate":"2020-11-05T18:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pinnimty-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We present an invert-and-edit framework to automatically transform facial weight of an input face image to look thinner or heavier by leveraging semantic facial attributes encoded in the latent space of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

This can help management of diet-related diseases like obesity, diabetes, and even cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, food logging can help fitness enthusiasts, and people who wanting to achieve a target weight. However, food-logging is cumbersome, and requires not only taking additional effort to note down the food item consumed regularly, but also sufficient knowledge of the food item consumed (which is difficult due to the availability of a wide variety of cuisines). With increasing reliance on smart devices, we exploit the convenience offered through the use of smart phones and propose a smart-food logging system: FoodAI, which offers state-of-the-art deep-learning based image recognition capabilities. FoodAI has been developed in Singapore and is particularly focused on food items commonly consumed in Singapore. FoodAI models were trained on a corpus of 400,000 food images from 756 different classes. In this paper we present extensive analysis and insights into the development of this system. FoodAI has been deployed as an API service and is one of the components powering Healthy 365, a mobile app developed by Singapore's Heath Promotion Board. We have over 100 registered organizations (universities, companies, start-ups) subscribing to this service and actively receive several API requests a day.

In this study, we analyze the healthy eating behaviors of active food journalers using data from MyFitnessPal. Surprisingly, our findings show that food journalers do not eat as healthily as they should despite their proclivity to health eating and their food choices resemble those of the general populace. Furthermore, we find that the journaling duration is only a marginal determinant of healthy eating outcomes and sociodemographic factors, such as gender and regions of residence, are much more predictive of healthy food choices.","tags":["Eating behaviors","Food journals","Healthy eating","Quantified self","food consumption","health"],"title":"Does Journaling Encourage Healthier Choices?

In this paper, we introduce random-loss incentive – a new financial incentive based on loss aversion and unpredictability principles – to address the problem of individuals' growing insensitivity to repeated interventions over time. We evaluate the new incentive design by conducting a randomized controlled trial to measure the influences of random losses on participants' dietary self-tracking and self-reporting compliance using a mobile web application called Eat \u0026 Tell.

Instead of using randomized controlled experiments, the existing approach simply tracks user browsing behaviors before and after a change is made to website design or web services, and evaluate the differences. To address the effects caused by hidden factors (e.g. promotion activities on the website) and to give fair comparison of different website designs, we propose the LASER system, a unified experimentation platform that enables randomized online controlled experiments to be easily conducted with minimal human effort and modifications to the experimented websites.

In this paper, we formulate the notion of irreversible outcome property which can be combined with pattern mining so as to automatically extract TPRs from any given game datasets. We specifically extend the well-known PrefixSpan sequence mining algorithm by incorporating the irreversible outcome property. To show the usefulness of TPRs, we apply them to Tetris, a popular game. We mine TPRs from Tetris games and generate challenging game sequences so as to help training an intelligent Tetris algorithm. Our experiment results show that 1) TPRs can be found from historical game data automatically with reasonable scalability, 2) our TPRs are able to help Tetris algorithm perform better when it is trained with challenging game sequences.","tags":null,"title":"On Finding the Point Where There Is No Return: Turning Point Mining on Game Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ee-Peng Lim","Palakorn Achananuparp"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1352678400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1352678400,"objectID":"95dc23262274b09808258e3640c32b07","permalink":"https://aekpalakorn.github.io/publication/lim-2012/","publishdate":"2019-10-09T06:50:14.334259Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lim-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"Unlike standard web search, people search microblog messages to look for temporally relevant information.

On the other hand, the same cannot be said for seeking incoming follow links which is useful in some application scenarios. In this paper, we therefore study the Follow Link Seeking Problem that aims to find the strategies for a source user to maximize the likelihood of receiving a follow link from a target user. We formulate this problem as a recommendation task and generate a set of strategies from well known follow link patterns. Using the confidence scores of follow link patterns, we derive the success probability of each strategy. Finally, we present Friender, a working recommender system for follow link seeking strategies.

At the level of constituency the predictive power of tweets was much weaker, although still better than chance.

We examine a community of Twitter users over a five month period, operationalizing social contagion as 'retweeting', and social structure as the count of subgraphs (small patterns of ties and nodes) between users in the follower/following network.We find that popular individuals act as 'inefficient hubs' for social contagion: they have limited attention, are overloaded with inputs, and therefore display limited responsiveness to viral messages. We argue this contradicts the 'law of the few' and 'influentials hypothesis'.We find that community structures, particularly reciprocal ties and certain triadic structures, substantially increase social contagion. This contradicts the theory that communities display lower internal contagion because of the inherent redundancy and lack of novelty of messages within a community. Instead, we speculate that the reasons community structures show increased social contagion are, first, that members of communities have higher similarity (reflecting shared interests and characteristics, increasing the relevance of messages), and second, that communities amplify the social bonding effect of retransmitted messages.","tags":["Community structures","Influentials hypothesis","Network motifs","Social contagion","Subgraphs","Twitter"],"title":"Influentials, novelty, and social contagion.

Instead of writing formal and lengthy messages, microbloggers prefer to frequently broadcast several short messages to be read by other users. Only when messages are interesting, are they propagated further by the readers. In this article, we examine user behavior relevant to information propagation through microblogging. We specifically use retweeting activities among Twitter users to define and model originating and promoting behavior. We propose a basic model for measuring the two behaviors, a mutual dependency model, which considers the mutual relationships between the two behaviors, and a range-based model, which considers the depth and reach of users' original tweets. Next, we compare the three behavior models and contrast them with the existing work on modeling influential Twitter users. Last, to demonstrate their applicability, we further employ the behavior models to detect interesting events from sudden changes in aggregated information propagation behavior of Twitter users. The results will show that the proposed behavior models can be effectively applied to detect interesting events in the Twitter stream, compared to the baseline tweet-based approaches.","tags":["Behavior modeling","Event detection","Information propagation","Originating behavior","Promoting behavior","Retweet","Twitter","Weak retweet"],"title":"Who is Retweeting the Tweeters?

They often contain the most important results to be reported, and provide rich information about the main themes in published papers. In the data mining and information retrieval community, there has been much effort on using text mining and language modeling algorithms to extract knowledge from the text content of online biomedical publications; however, the problem of knowledge extraction from biomedical images and captions has not been fully studied yet. In this paper, a hierarchical probabilistic topic model with background distribution (HPB) is introduced to uncover the latent semantic topics from the co-occurrence patterns of caption words, visual words and biomedical concepts. With downloaded biomedical figures, restricted captions are extracted with regard to each individual image panel. During the indexing stage, the 'bag-of-words' representation of captions is supplemented by an ontology-based concept indexing to alleviate the synonym and polysemy problems. As the visual counterpart of text words, the visual words are extracted and indexed from corresponding image panels. The model is estimated via collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm. We compare the performance of our model with the extension of the Correspondence LDA (Corr-LDA) model under the same biomedical image annotation scenario using cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model is able to accurately extract latent patterns from complicated biomedical image-caption pairs and facilitate knowledge organization and understanding in online biomedical literatures.","tags":["Automatic image annotation","Bioinformatics","Gibbs sampling","Probabilistic models","Topic learning","Visual words"],"title":"Probabilistic models for topic learning from images and captions in online biomedical literatures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Palakorn Achananuparp","Christopher C.

The variability of natural language expression makes it difficult for existing text similarity measures to accurately identify semantically similar sentences since sentences conveying the same fact or concept may be composed lexically and syntactically different. Inversely, sentences which are lexically common may not necessarily convey the same meaning. This poses a significant impact on many text mining applications' performance where sentence-level judgment is involved. The evaluation has shown that, by processing sentence at its semantic level, the performance of similarity measures is significantly improved.","tags":["Semantic equivalence","Sentence semantics","Sentence similarity","Structural similarity","Textual entailment","Verbargument structure"],"title":"Addressing the variability of natural language Expression in sentence similarity with semantic structure of the sentences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Palakorn Achananuparp","Xiaohua Hu","Xiaohua Zhou","Xiaodan Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1228176000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1228176000,"objectID":"f1da2c697344883a35704be0b9b256e2","permalink":"https://aekpalakorn.github.io/publication/achananuparp-2008-a/","publishdate":"2019-10-09T06:50:14.340773Z","relpermalink":"/publication/achananuparp-2008-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Digital reference services normally rely on human experts to provide quality answers to the user requests via online communication tools. As the services gain more popularity, more experts are needed to keep up with a growing demand. Alternatively, automated question answering module can help shorten the question-answering cycle. When the system receives a new user submitted question, the similarity of the user's request and the existing questions in the archive can be compared. If the appropriate match is found, the system then uses the associated answer to response to such request. Since a question is relatively short and two questions might contain very few words in common, the challenge is how to effectively identify the similarity of questions. In this paper, we focus on the problem of identifying questions that convey the similar information need. That is, our goal is to find paraphrases of the original questions. To achieve this, we propose a hybrid approach that combines semantic, syntactic, and question category to judge question similarity. Semantic and syntactic information is measured by taking into account word similarity, word order, and part of speech information. Information about the types of question is derived from a Support Vector Machine classifier. The experimental results demonstrate that our combined measures are highly effective in distinguishing original questions and their paraphrases, thus improving the potency of question matching task.","tags":["Answer reuse","Factoid questions","Question answering","Question categories","Question similarity","Semantic and syntactic techniques","Sentence similarity"],"title":"Utilizing Semantic, Syntactic, and Question category Information for Automated Digital Reference Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Palakorn Achananuparp","Xiaohua Hu","Xiajiong Shen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1220227200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1220227200,"objectID":"69c941d4c5e8d368fdf40ba0a9f57188","permalink":"https://aekpalakorn.github.io/publication/achananuparp-2008/","publishdate":"2019-10-09T06:50:14.339874Z","relpermalink":"/publication/achananuparp-2008/","section":"publication","summary":"The ability to accurately judge the similarity between natural language sentences is critical to the performance of several applications such as text mining, question answering, and text summarization.

That is, the correct similarity judgment should be made even if the sentences do not share similar surface form.

Traditional document representation approaches typically adopt a popular bag-of-word method as the underlying document representation. Although it's a simple and efficient method, the major shortcoming of bag-of-word representation is in the independent of word feature assumption. Many researchers have attempted to address this issue by incorporating semantic information into document representation. In this paper, we study the effect of semantic representation on the effectiveness of text classification systems. We employed a novel semantic smoothing technique to derive semantic information in a form of mapping probability between topic signatures and single-word features. Two classifiers, Näive Bayes and Support Vector Machine, were selected to carry out the classification experiments. Overall, our topic-signature semantic representation approaches significantly outperformed traditional bag-of-word representation in most datasets.","tags":null,"title":"Semantic Representation in Text Classification using Topic Signature Mapping","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaodan Zhang","Xiaohua Hu","Jiali Xia","Xiaohua Zhou","Palakorn Achananuparp"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"a454ea6a5e7bc0b2ed4ddfe34f6b8968","permalink":"https://aekpalakorn.github.io/publication/zhang-2008/","publishdate":"2019-10-09T06:50:14.339461Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-2008/","section":"publication","summary":"In this article, we present a graph-based knowledge representation for biomedical digital library literature clustering An efficient clustering method is developed to identify the ontology-enriched k-highest density term subgraphs that capture the core semantic relationship information about each document cluster The distance between each document and the k term graph clusters is calculated.

One big problem with document clustering is how to discount the effects of class-unspecific general terms and strengthen the effects of class-specific core terms. We claim that a well constructed term graph can help improve the global ranking of classspecific core terms. We first apply PageRank and HITS to a directed abstracttitle term graph to target class specific core terms. Then k dense term clusters (graphs) are identified from these terms. Last, each document is assigned to its closest core term graph. A series of experiments are conducted on a document corpus collected from PubMed.

However, due to the problem of dimensionality in the vector space model, a simple term vector is not a sufficient representation of the user model as it ignores the semantic relations between terms. In this paper, we present a novel method to enhance a traditional term-based user model with WordNet-based semantic similarity techniques. To achieve this, we use word definitions and relationship hierarchies in WordNet to perform word sense disambiguation and employ domain-specific concepts as category labels for the derived user models. We tested our method on Windows to the Universe, a public educational website covering subjects in the Earth and Space Sciences, and performed an evaluation of our semantically enhanced user models against human judgment. Our approach is distinguishable from existing work because we automatically narrow down the set of domain specific concepts from initial domain concepts obtained from Wikipedia and because we automatically create semantically enhanced user models.","tags":["Content-based user modeling","Implicit user modeling","Semantic techniques"],"title":"Semantically Enhanced User Modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.hen Wu","Xiaohua Hu","Zhoujun Li","Xiaohua Zhou","Palakorn Achananuparp"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"fa50034537437ad767a1f3443e4c3343","permalink":"https://aekpalakorn.github.io/publication/wu-2007/","publishdate":"2019-10-09T06:50:14.342488Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wu-2007/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes some expanded rough set models with maximal compatible classes as primitive granules, introduces two new granules for extending rough set model, and designs algorithms to solve maximal compatible classes, to find the lower and upper approximations according to the newly granules, to compute reducts and minimal reducts with attribute significance.
