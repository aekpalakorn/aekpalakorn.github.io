abstract = {Interests in the automatic generation of cooking recipes have been growing steadily over the past few years thanks to a large amount of online cooking recipes. We present RecipeGPT, a novel online recipe generation and evaluation system. The system provides two modes of text generations: (1) instruction generation from given recipe title and ingredients; and (2) ingredient generation from recipe title and cooking instructions. Its back-end text generation module comprises a generative pre-trained language model GPT-2 fine-tuned on a large cooking recipe dataset. Moreover, the recipe evaluation module allows the users to conveniently inspect the quality of the generated recipe contents and store the results for future reference. RecipeGPT can be accessed online at  https://recipegpt.org/ },
